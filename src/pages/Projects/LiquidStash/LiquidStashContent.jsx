                            In developing LiquidStash's platform, we encountered several interrelated design challenges. The project demanded a seamless information architecture that could intuitively present complex financial data to a diverse range of users. This need for clarity had to be balanced with the requirement for a robust, scalable system capable of supporting increasing transaction volumes and data loads.

                            Additionally, simplifying the data visualizations to ensure they were accessible yet informative posed a significant challenge. Equally crucial was our effort to refine and streamline complex workflows, enhancing the overall user experience by reducing operational friction.

                            The traditional periodontal chart form sheet has roughly 960 form fields to populate in a A4 format, with little to none visual cues.
                            We had to break down the form into four steps, essentially dictated by the different ways the mouth can be sectioned. This approach prevents the overwhelm that comes from seeing all the information at once without a clear visual entry point. This involves one crucial UX Principle to forms of this characteristics, the Progressive Disclosure.

                            We sucessfully targeted and solved every problem described by the client, improving all the business core KPI's and creating a great user experience.
                            For measuring the product UX we conducted a little survey comparing before and after the design treatment. Our test subject, a dentist friend of the client, rated the "Frustration Index" with 2/10 for our redesign, and 7/10 for the traditional approach.
